# 
# # 1. Decision Tree
# 
# ![Capture.PNG](attachment:Capture.PNG)
# 
# Decision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning.
# 
# The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and modern variations like random forest are among the most powerful techniques available.
# 
# Classification and Regression Trees or `CART` for short is a term introduced by `Leo Breiman` to refer to Decision Tree algorithms that can be used for classification or regression predictive modeling problems.
# 
# Classically, this algorithm is referred to as ‚Äú`decision trees`‚Äù, but on some platforms like R they are referred to by the more modern term CART.
# 
# The `CART` algorithm provides a foundation for important algorithms like `bagged decision trees`, `random forest` and `boosted decision trees`.
# 
# ### CART Model Representation
# The representation for the CART model is a binary tree.
# 
# This is your binary tree from algorithms and data structures, nothing too fancy. Each root node represents a single input variable (x) and a split point on that variable (assuming the variable is numeric).
# 
# The leaf nodes of the tree contain an output variable (y) which is used to make a prediction.
# 
# Given a new input, the tree is traversed by evaluating the specific input started at the root node of the tree.
# 
# #### Some **advantages** of decision trees are:
# * Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.
# * Requires little data preparation. 
# * Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
# * Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. 
# * Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.
# 
# #### The **disadvantages** of decision trees include:
# * Overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
# * Decision trees can be unstable. Mitigant: Use decision trees within an ensemble.
# * Cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. Mitigant: Training multiple trees in an ensemble learner
# * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. Recommendation: Balance the dataset prior to fitting
# 
# # 2. Random Forest
# Random Forest is one of the most popular and most powerful machine learning algorithms. It is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging.

# ## 1. Decision Tree Classifier
# 
# **Decision Tree parameters:**
# - `criterion`: The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are "`gini`" for the Gini impurity and "`entropy`" for the information gain.
# ***
# - `splitter`: The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported strategies are "`best`" to choose the best split and "`random`" to choose the best random split.
# ***
# - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than `min_samples_split` samples.
# ***
# - `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
# ***
# - `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
# ***
# - `min_weight_fraction_leaf`: The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
# ***
# - `max_features`: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
# ***
# - `max_leaf_nodes`: Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
# ***
# - `min_impurity_decrease`: A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.
# ***
# - `min_impurity_split`: Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

# # 3. Random Forest
# 
# A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
# 
# - **Random forest algorithm parameters:**
# - `n_estimators`: The number of trees in the forest.
# *** 
# - `criterion`: The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are "`gini`" for the Gini impurity and "`entropy`" for the information gain.
# ***
# - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than `min_samples_split` samples.
# ***
# - `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
# ***
# - `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
# ***
# - `min_weight_fraction_leaf`: The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.
# ***
# - `max_features`: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
# ***
# - `max_leaf_nodes`: Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion. Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
# ***
# - `min_impurity_decrease`: A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value.
# ***
# - `min_impurity_split`: Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.
# ***
# - `bootstrap`: Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the whole datset is used to build each tree.
# ***
# - `oob_score`: Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization accuracy.

# # Summary
# In this notebook we learned the following lessons:
# - Decsion tree and random forest algorithms and the parameters of each algorithm.
# - How to tune hyperparameters for both Decision tree and Random Forest.
# - Balance your dataset before training to prevent the tree from being biased toward the classes that are dominant. 
#   - By sampling an equal number of samples from each class  
#   - By normalizing the sum of the sample weights (sample_weight) for each class to the same value.
