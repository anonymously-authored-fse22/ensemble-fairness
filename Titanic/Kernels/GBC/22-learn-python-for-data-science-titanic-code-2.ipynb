the feature Cabin.\n\n1.There were more male(65%) than female(35%) on Titanic.But during time of rescue preference was given to Female and children.Only 38% People ended up surviving on Titanic.75% Female and 18% Male survived.\n\n2.Most passengers(491) travelled in third class.Passengers from first class were given preference while carrying out the rescue.55%,20.7% and 24.2% people travelled in 3rd,2nd and 1st class respectivel.63%,47% & 24% of the passengers survived in 1st,2nd and 3rd Pclass respectively.\n\n3.We can see the distribution of fare was higher in 1st class from 0-300 dollars and some people even paid 500 dollars.For 2nd class the distrubution of fare is more between 0-40 dollars and there are some passangers who paid in the reange 60-80 dollars.Most passangers in 3rd class paid between 0-30 dollars for few people fare was higher reaching upto 70 dollars.Woemn travelling in 1st class were charged more compared to men.\n\n4.Most Passengers on Titanic were in the age group 20-40.Fare for most passangers was in in the Range 0-40 $.In some cases Fare for Female was more than Males.\n\n5.Children less than 5 years survived.So again the pattern of children and women given preference when it came to rescue.Most deaths happened in the age group 15-30.Most who survived were als in the age group is 15-35.The oldest person who was 80 years old survived.But many Senior Citizens in the age group 60-75 lost their lives.Mean age in first,Second and Third class is around 37,30 and 22 respectively\n\n6.most people on Titanic travelled alone.f people had some one with them it increased there chance of survival when SibSp was 1 & 2 .This could be because these one family member would have helped other to survive.Also they must have travelled in 1st and 2nd class.If we note when SibSp goes beyond 3 then the survival percentage decreases.This is because the people with SibSp greater than 3 travelled in 3rd class.\n\n7.We can see that people who were alone had less chance of survival.There are two reason for this.They mostly travelled in 3rd class and there was no one along with them to help them out.Survival rate was higher for Parch 1 to 3 and was very low for Parch 4 to 6.This is because famalies with higher Parch travelled in 3rd class.\n\n8.More people boarded from S ( Southampton) followed by C(Cherbourg) and then Q(Queenstown).Around 200 people from Southampton survived. Followed by around 90 from Cherbourg and 30 from Queenstown.We can see that close to 55% People from Cherbourg survived.35 %  people from Queenstown survived.Less than 35 % of the people from Southampton survived.\n\n9.We have build various machine learning models and rated them based on their accuracy.\n\n10.We have used boosting techiniques and found out the important features in the dataset.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TO BE CONTINUED"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6477b84a66e9ef41fe5ccb555c761b86cda88e3b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#
