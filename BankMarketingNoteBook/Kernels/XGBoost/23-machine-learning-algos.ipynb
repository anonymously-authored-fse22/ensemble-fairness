Regression\n\nThis is the most basic algorithm. There is no magic in it. All the concept is borrowed from the field of statistics. The main idea is to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Consider you have 2 variables x(independent) and y(dependent) we need to find the following relationship: \n$$ y = B_0x + B_1 $$\nhere $B_0$ and $B_1$ are learnable parameters.\n\nLogistic regression is basically *LinearRegression + CrossEntropyLoss*. So in order to understand LogisticRegression, we must know what LinearRegression is.\n\n### Linear Regression\n`LinearRegression` from `Scikit Learn` uses covariance, mean and variance statistics to calculate $B_0$ and $B_1$. The basic formula is:\n$$ B_0 = {cov(x, y) \\over variance(x)} $$\n\n$$ B_1 = mean(y) - B_1 * mean(x) $$\n\n<img src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tWOGQiH9nUk/XDIJYqAQqkI/AAAAAAAADFs/f-8EnXVslIgyeXO1IlRHI3XzPu95gkrVgCLcBGAs/s1600/residuals.gif\"></img>\n\n\n### SGD Regression\nUsually, Linear regression uses gradient-descent to calculate gradients to update the parameters in order to reduce the loss. Here the loss is the sum of the distance between the points and the optimal regression line. This algorithm is available with `SGDRegressor` in Scikit-Learn. Each variable is assigned a random weight $W_i$ and this weight is changed with each gradient-descent step. The steps are as follows:\n1. Calculate the predictions with current values of $W_1, W_2, W_3, ...$\n2. Calculate the loss\n3. Calculate the gradient of $W_i$ with respect to the loss.\n4. Update the weights $W_i$ using gradient descent.\n\nGradient Descent step is defined as:\n$$ W_i = W_i - \\alpha*dW_i $$\nhere, alpha is learning-rate which is basically the step-size contributing the amount of gradient we want to consider in each step. <br>\nCheck out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMh0zPT0tLI) to understand gradient-descent visually.\n\n### Logistic Regression\nNow, in case of Logistic-Regression we use cross-entropy loss. Entropy defines the degree of chaos. First we need to squish our predictions between 0 and 1 to make it as the predicted probability and then this value is used to calculate the cross_entropy loss. The formulas are:\n$$ p_i = {1 \\over {1 + e^{-W^Tx}}} $$\n$$ loss = -\\sum_{i=0}^n y_ilog(p_i) + (1-y_i)log(1-p_i) $$\nhere, $y_i$ is the $i_{th}$ target value and $W^Tx$ is the prediction. <br>\nHere is a [reference playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUKxzEP5HA2d-Li7IJkHfXSe) to understand this algorithm visually."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = LogisticRegression(C=4.6416, class_weight='balanced', n_jobs=-1, random_state=7)\nget_cross_val(model, df, y, skf)\nprint_metric(model, df, y, scaler=StandardScaler())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2. Support Vector Machines\n\nSupport vector machines(SVM) are mostly used for classification problems although they can be used for regression too. The main idea is to find a hyperplane within the n-dimensional space in order to maximize the distance between hyperplane and data-points. These data-points are called support vectors and the distance is called the margin.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/SVM_margin.png/300px-SVM_margin.png\" width=\"300\"></img>\n\nIn the above case, the data is spread across the dimension space so a linear hyperplane can be drawn easily, but sometimes it's not possible to do that.

The bayes theorem is as follows:\n$$ P({c \\over d}) =  {{p({d \\over c}) p(c)} \\over {p(d)}} $$\nhere,\n- $p({c \\over d})$: probability that $d$ belongs to class $c$\n- $p({d \\over c})$: probability of data of the class $c$\n- $p({c})$: probability of class $c$\n- $p({d})$ predictive prior probability i.e probability of data irrespective of the class."},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = GaussianNB()\nget_cross_val(model, df, y, skf)\nprint_metric(model, df, y, scaler=StandardScaler())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. K-Nearest Neighbors\n\nKNN is the simplest one. New test data is assigned the values which the nearest K neighbors possess. First, it finds it's K-nearest neighbors using either Euclidean distance or Hamming distance and then considers only those points to predict a value. In the case of the regression, the predicted value can be the average or weight average of the target values of those points and in case of classification, it takes the majority class among its peers.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.fromthegenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/K_NN_Ad.jpg\" width=\"400\"></img>"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, n_jobs=-1)\nget_cross_val(model, df, y, skf)\nprint_metric(model, df, y, scaler=StandardScaler())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Decision Tree\n\nDecision trees are basically similar to binary trees. Each node has 2 child nodes except the leaf nodes. We select a feature everytime we make a split at some node using some evaluation criterion. The commonly used criterion for regression is based on variance. Here, we iterate over all the features and in each feature we iterate over the possible points between the lower-bound and upper-bound of the feature values and calculate information gain(IG). To calculate information we first calculate the initial entropy and final entropy after we make a split based on the currently selected feature value. For example, let's say we split on a leaf based on some feature 'age'. Data with age < 10 goes towards left and others on right.\n\nNow for each new leaf, we calculate entropy and further calculate information gain using its parent node. Since entropy means the degree of chaos and decrease in entropy is means increase in information gain after the split so we take that feature and its value as the best split point.\n$$ Entropy(S_O) = -\\sum_{i=1}^N {p_i log_2(p_i)}$$\n\n$$ IG = S_O - \\sum_{i=1}^2 {N_i \\over N}S_i $$\n\n<img src=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse_open/blob/master/img/topic3_credit_scoring_entropy.png\"></img>\n\nCheck out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VeUPuFGJHk) to understand decision trees better."},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, max_features=0.5, random_state=7)\nget_cross_val(model, df, y, skf)\nprint_metric(model, df, y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"hidden":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Let's visualize the decision tree**"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dot_data = StringIO()\nexport_graphviz(model, out_file=dot_data,\n                filled=True, rounded=True,\n                special_characters=True)\n\ngraph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())  \nImage(graph.create_png())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6. RandomForest\n\nRandomForest is just an ensemble of the decision trees. A single decision tree is not enough to predict a value so RandomForest creates an ensemble of decision trees randomly. The random keyword specifies certain parameters, which adds randomness either during initialization or during training. One of them is `max_features`, which chooses a sample of features randomly with each decision tree to reduce overfitting and introduce stable and robust training. RandomForest by default doesn't choose all the data points with each iteration of training but uses a subsample of it. Also, it has `oob_score` which calculates the metric score on the data left out during subsampling.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/592/1*i0o8mjFfCn-uD79-F1Cqkw.png\" width=\"500\"></img>"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced', max_depth=12, max_features=0.7,\n                               n_estimators=50, n_jobs=-1, random_state=7)\nget_cross_val(model, df, y, skf)\nprint_metric(model, df, y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.

Using these predictions it re-weigh the input data in which the incorrectly predicted instances are assigned a higher weight and correctly predicted instances are assigned lower weights.\n3. Then it forms a new data frame in which the instances are selected based on the assigned weights.\n4. Again repeat step 1 with this new data.\n5.

Create residuals using the actual value and the initial prediction.\n3. Build a tree to predict these residuals.\n4. Take the average of the residuals corresponding to the data point and make it as the new predictions.\n5. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 until the number of trees is formed as assigned in the algorithm instance.\n6.

Check out this amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ) for step-wise explanation. \n\nTheoritically the PCA components are calculated as follows:\n1. Normalize the data.\n2. Shift the data points such that the mean of the data becomes 0.\n3. Get the first principle component which is basically a line on which the perpendicular projection distance of each data point is minimum.\n4. Draw more principle components such the each new component is perpendicular to the previous one. We can have maximum n components, where n is total number of features.\n5. Draw the variance graph(skree plot) and choose the optimal number of principle components.\n6. Take the choosen principle components and project the data points on each of them.\n7.

KNN chooses random initial points or initial centroids so the algorithm doesn't guarantee an optimal result. Although it uses `k-means++` to initialize the points still it is random. The steps for this algorithm are as follows:\n1. Initialize K-points.\n2. For each data, point finds the closest centroid and assign the class of the centroid to it.\n3. Find new centroids among all the clusters formed by averaging the independent variables.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until new centroids are the same as the previous ones.\n5. For each new data point in testing assign the label of the centroid it is closest to.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tWaaZX75oumVwBMcKN-eHA.png\" width=\"600\"></img>\n\nCheck out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA) for more."},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, n_jobs=-1, random_state=7)\nprint_metric(model, df, y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# End"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.2"},"varInspector":{"cols":{"lenName":16,"lenType":16,"lenVar":40},"kernels_config":{"python":{"delete_cmd_postfix":"","delete_cmd_prefix":"del ","library":"var_list.py","varRefreshCmd":"print(var_dic_list())"},"r":{"delete_cmd_postfix":") ","delete_cmd_prefix":"rm(","library":"var_list.r","varRefreshCmd":"cat(var_dic_list()) "}},"types_to_exclude":["module","function","builtin_function_or_method","instance","_Feature"],"window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
