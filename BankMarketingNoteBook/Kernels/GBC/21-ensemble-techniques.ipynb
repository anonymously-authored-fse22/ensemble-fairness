Support Vactor Machine Classifier\n> SVM is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. Given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.                                                \n2. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n> The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that's used for classification task. The crux of classifier is based on the Bayes theorem                                                                                       \nGaussian - When the predictors take up a continous value and are not discrete, we assume that these values are sampled from a gaussian distribution\n3. K-Nearest Neighbour\n    > KNN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. It consists of k closest training examples in the feature space. In Classification the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbours, with the object being assigned to the class most among its K nearest neighbors ( K is positive integer, typically the small) if k = 1 then the object is simply assigned to the same class of that single nearest neighbor\n4. Logistic Regression\n> A Supervised classification algorithm. It used Sigmoid function for classifying the binary labelled output variables. \n5. XGBoost\n> eXtreme Gradient Boosting is a library of gradient boosting algorithms. It leverages the techniques mentioned with boosting and comes wrapped in easy to use library. Some major benefits includes highly scalable, quick to execute and out performs other algorithms. \n6. Decision Tree\n> Is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature, the branch represents a decision rule and each leaf node represents the outcome. Repetitively divides the working area into sub part by identifying lines. \n7. Decision Tree Entropy\n> Entropy used to construct decision trees. To calculate the homogeneity of a sample. If the sample is completly homogeneous the entropy is zero and if the sample is equally divided then it has entropy of one. \n8. Random Forest\n> A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a nummber of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting\n9. Adaboost Classifier\n> The core definition of boosting is a method that converts weak leaners to strong learners and is typically applied to trees. Boosting Algorithm adds iterations of the model sequentially, adjusting the weights of the weak-learners along the way. This reduces the bias from the model and typically improves accuracy.  \n10. Bagging Classifier\n> Bootstrap Aggregation or Bagging has two distinct features. For training it leverages a Bootstrap procedure to separate the training data into different random subsamples. For prediction, a bagging classifier will use the prediction with the most votes from each model to produce its output and a bagging regression will take an average of all models to produce an output. \n11. GradientBoost Classifier\n> Gradient boosted classification is an addictive training free classification method where trees are build in series and compared to each other based on mathematically derived score of splits. The trees are compared based on weighted leaf scores within each leaf "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Support Vector Machines "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn import svm\n\nsvm = svm.SVC(probability=True, gamma='auto')\nsvm_model = svm.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nsvm_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"k_fold = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=0)\n\nprint('Accuracy', metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, svm_pred))\nprint('F1 core', metrics.f1_score(y_test, svm_pred))\nprint('\\n')                                                                                                                \nprint('Scoring on Training Dataset', svm.score(X_train, y_train))\nprint('Scoring on Test Dataset', svm.score(X_test, y_test))\nprint('\\n')                                                                                                                \nprint('Confusion matrix \\n',confusion_matrix(y_test, svm_pred))\nprint('\\n')\nfalse_positive_rate, true_positive_rate, thresholds = roc_curve(y, svm_model.predict_proba(X)[:,1])\nprint('AUC Score',auc(false_positive_rate, true_positive_rate))\nprint('roc_auc_score',roc_auc_score(y, svm_model.predict(X)))\n\nSVM = (cross_val_score(svm_model, X_train, y_train, cv=k_fold, n_jobs=1, scoring='accuracy').mean())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Notes on Results:\n1.
